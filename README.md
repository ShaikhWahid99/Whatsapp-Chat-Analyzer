Developed in my 6th semester as a part of Python practice and data analysis exploration. This tool analyzes exported WhatsApp chats and generates insights like most active participants, message frequency, emoji usage, and more using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

This project was built earlier, but I’m sharing it now to highlight my data-handling and Python scripting capabilities relevant to the internship role I’m applying for.

This project is made using python librarires like :-
1) Pandas
2) Numpy
3) Matplot lib
4) Streamlit
